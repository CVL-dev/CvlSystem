# Uncomment the following to turn on the user access control list whenever

# (Default: user ACL is disabled)

# Uncomment the following to globally disable the ability to make reverse
# VNC connections.
# (Default: reverse connections are allowed)

no-reverse-connections

# Uncomment the following to globally disable inbound connections to all
# TurboVNC servers running on this machine.  This effectively forces SSH
# tunneling to be used for all inbound TurboVNC connections.
# (Default: inbound remote connections are allowed)

#no-remote-connections

# Set pam-service-name to the name of the PAM service that you will use to
# to process Unix login (user & password) authentications from TurboVNC.  This
# service name typically corresponds to a file in /etc/pam.d or to one or more
# lines in /etc/pam.conf.
# (Default: turbovnc)

# Set the following to any combination of "vnc", "otp", "pam-userpwd", or
# "none", separated by commas.  If the following variable is enabled and
# a particular authentication method is not listed in it, then users cannot
# enable that authentication method by using Xvnc command line arguments.  This
# variable also controls the order in which the corresponding authentication
# capabilities are advertised to the TurboVNC Viewer.
# (Default: vnc, otp, pam-userpwd, none)
